- User registration and login.
- Admin and normal user functionality.
- Team creation and management by users.
- Contests managed by admins.

## Key Relationships

- **Inheritance**:
    - `NormalUser` and `AdminUser` inherit from the abstract `User` class.

- **Associations**:
    - **User and Contest**: A user can join multiple contests.
    - **User and Team**: A user can create multiple teams for different games.
    - **Team and Player**: A team consists of a list of players.
    - **Contest and Game**: Each contest is associated with one game.

## Design Principles Applied

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**:
    - Each class has a specific responsibility (e.g., `User` manages user data, `Contest` handles contest-related logic).

2. **Open-Closed Principle**:
    - Classes like `User` and `Contest` can be extended (e.g., for admin or different types of contests) without modifying existing code.

3. **Interface Segregation Principle**:
    - `ScoringStrategy` is an interface, allowing different scoring systems to be used without affecting the main classes.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dream11-fantasy-sports.git
   cd dream11-fantasy-sports
